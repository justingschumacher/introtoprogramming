    <h1> Tags </h1>
      <p>
        Tags are used to <em>format text, add picutres and links</em>.
        There are inline and block tags, with the difference being that block
        tags will create a box around the content, which can be manipulated.

    <h2> Additional Thoughts </h2>
      <p>
        It's important to remember that <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">
        other websites </a> have <b>significant</b> information available,
        when I'm stuck. Also, using ATOM with the html preview plugin is really
        helpful.

    <h3> Last Musings </h3>
      <p>
        There's not a lot of notes here, as I feel like I had a decent
        understanding already. Looking forward to more indepth information!
